# Pac-Man-Animation
## Description
Do you remember the friendly little yellow ball from the 80's that just eats, eats and eats?? Exactly, we are talking about Pac-Man.

This project is an animation work that uses this famous character to show how much fun web development can be and how powerful the combination of languages like HTML and JavaScript can be.

## Usage
Consider the following for a better experience interacting with the program:
- Just download the project, unzip the folder and open the index.html file in any browser (Chrome is recommended).
- Our yellow character is observed standing still. To put it in motion, click on it and watch the magic.
- Movement is from left to right across the entire available width of the window. If this parameter is changed then refresh the page and click again to put Pac-Man in motion.

## Roadmap
At the moment the project does not try to replicate the original behavior of the Pac-man game, it is only intended to simulate the movement using front-end web development languages.

Some changes proposed for this work are:
- Add interaction with other objects.
- Add colors and text using a style sheet.
